<div lang="en" dir="auto" class="book e-content"><p style="
">Today a Vietnamese friend let me know to prepare for the city to shutdown for a week or so. Many services will be affected. I went shopping for some basic food items at the Big C grocery store. It’s like the larger Safeway or Lucky stores. Got mostly food easy to cook and not needing a fridge. Also bought coffee since that’s one of the things affected. No coffee shops open for a week.</p>

<p>I believe I am okay now but I can still order food online using grab. I asked my Airbnb host to make available purified water to all of us and he will help with that and any other stuff we may need. I need to buy a case of beer I think. Gonna do that tonight or tomorrow.</p>

<p>What this means here is we are locked in here until mid April and there are no flights in or out. I would not want to leave anyways. Here I feel safer.</p>

<p>I’ll continue to blog and take pictures and do my solitary walks each day. I want to always remember this and what a great job Vietnam has done for everyone. Pictures and blogging work good for me. Tomorrow I will buy more viettel mobile credit just in case. I have a good data plan now which is month by month.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting time. Not scary and there is no panic here. It’s just everyone obeying what the government says. We do that because they are honest and open and transparent. Unlike one US president I know. I won’t go to my feelings about the US now. I will never forgive and forget what trump did though or did not do. The idea of opening the economy on Easter is ludicrous. You will spike the curve and more will sicken and die.</p>

<p>So now I go to walk soon. I’ve eaten and done the shopping. I feel good. Bring it on. It’s always day by day here. I am particularly thankful to my wondrous Vietnamese friends for ensuring I knew what was going on and how to prepare for it.</p>

<div lang="en" dir="auto" class="book e-content"><p>I don’t know if I will write every day. Overnight the Vietnam government announced a lock on all people entering. Also there are no international flights going or coming into Vietnam now. So life in this closely knit fabric of countries called Southeast Asia has changed both individually and collectively. The new reality is that there is no “life as usual” and that fabric of life, people, history and customs has frayed along many lines.</p>

<p>Life in Hanoi which is what I write about more now is like this:</p>
<ol><li><p>Many coffee shops and restaurants are open and serve me with the same hospitality and friendliness as before. I can easily find international and local food close to where I live.</p></li>

<li><p>Food is easy to find and one can shop at the small stores or go to markets for fresh stuff. I can find apples, oranges, pineapple, all kinds of meat and poultry and a lot of coffee and rice.</p></li>

<li><p>People in Hanoi are a gregarious lot. Early evenings are marked with visits to parks, exercise sessions, eating and visiting. I see this every evening and at the local coffee shops I frequent.</p></li>

<li><p>Life is not hard here at all. In fact it’s pretty carefree. No one curtails movement and everyone voluntarily accepts the government limits and conditions.</p></li>

<li><p>I go for solitary walks every day. Now I take my FujiFilm X-T30 camera because I’m enjoying using it again. I get 5 miles a day walking. I have the streets I know with government presence but I never have felt unsafe in Vietnam. Walking or shopping in my neighborhood has been the same.</p></li></ol>

<p>All that being said I yearn for the freedom again to just go. I’d like to make it to Cambodia in May. We shall see.</p>

<p><em>coffee shop times</em></p>

<p>Now I am at my favorite coffee shop. I had a fresh almond croissant and a hot latte. I will stay for one more. They welcome me gladly and I just sit. Sometimes longer and often even longer. It’s a wonderful shop with numerous rooms and a balcony if you want. I sit in the corner and relax on their WiFi which is free and just read or think of the day. I made a decision to try and not reflect on tomorrow. To just take it every day. I’m grateful to be here. I’m in no rush for a thing but perhaps that yearning to know at some point I’m free to go. I think that part is human nature.</p>

<p>So from here on you will see more of my day to day here. The Day One journal and the blog kinda blur together. Hanoi still moves. Bikes and buses go. People still treat me with that legendary hospitality or close to it.</p>

<p>For all I am thankful. A new day has come.</p>

<div lang="en" dir="auto" class="book e-content"><p>I’m writing this mostly as a voice of a person now unable to leave Vietnam nor really wanting to. The US embassy has advised that US citizens that can should remain in Vietnam indefinitely. To stay here I believe you need a mindset that life is a day to day affair. Vietnam is not a difficult or expensive country to remain in. Just consider the following:</p>
<ol><li><p>The borders are locked. It’s almost impossible to get in now unless you meet stringent prerequisites.</p></li>

<li><p>International flights have been curtailed and will soon be stopped. There is no reason to fly domestically anywhere.</p></li>

<li><p>The Vietnamese Ministry of Health has texted everyone with the rules for self quarantine and distancing. They do not stop exercise or walking in parks or trails. They do require face masks and they require no matter who if you have landed since 1 March to fill out health check and mandatory quarantine no matter if foreigner or Vietnamese. I came in two weeks before but have done the online health check.</p></li></ol>

<p>If you find yourself in a similar situation try to take life day by day. Nothing is going to be any different until it is different. If in Southeast Asia use local resources like google maps to your advantage. Be careful at a reasonable and prudent level. Get the grab app and you can order food online and have it delivered.</p>

<p>For me I have the resources and have lived in Southeast Asia for some years. I have the basic things like an unlocked iPhone and a good data plan. I know my neighborhood and they know me. I’m not denied basic life needs like fruit, water and others.</p>

<p>Do not fear and be calm and take the day to day. I have Vietnamese friends that care about me and family in the United States that do as well. It’s more difficult for them. My daughter living on fixed income in Florida has a variety of issues around food and basic necessities. Rent at one point became an issue but the state government is providing assistance.</p>

<p>My main message is to accept that life is going to have a great deal of unknowns and don’t stress over things you don’t know. Be brave and resourceful. Get out and exercise. I walk and practice social distancing and record life with my camera. Practice good hygiene. Try living a simpler life. Keep your head in the present and don’t fret tomorrow. It will come and offer good and bad things no matter what you do.</p>

<p>If you find yourself like me and will be staying for an indefinite time try recording in a life journal day by day. When you look back in some future time you will be amazed at your courage and fortitude. Try taking pictures of life now in your country. Don’t worry about what it may mean tomorrow to stay. It likely is safer than America is now especially if you find yourself in Southeast Asia. Don’t be afraid of the government or immigration in your country. Just take on what life offers and see the value every day.</p>

<p>I’ll stay here until I don’t any longer. I don’t know when that is. My own embassy has little in the way of assistance programs. So here’s the final piece of advice:</p>

<blockquote><p> don’t look back. You are not going that way</p></blockquote>

<p>Just stay to today. Tomorrow will come and show you new things. We live in a time of great change and countries and governments are doing what they can and must do.</p>

<p>Think about starting a blog and give a new look to your life. Keep that daily personal diary. It’s all gonna change but we don’t know to what or when. This means you have the moments of today.</p>

<p>Live on folks. I am.</p>

<div lang="en" dir="auto" class="book e-content"><p>I flew back to Hanoi today from Saigon. Very interesting and sometimes stressful. The flight lasts 2 hours. I was perhaps the only non-Vietnamese on the flight. It gave me some pause and it also made me think a bit of what we bloggers should do in the face of covid-19. Here are some things I would like to see bloggers do:</p>
<ol><li><p>Speak out with passion on the dangers and inform us with reporting from the trenches. Many expats are in countries that are locked down now. We look for a voice of reason. So how about you bloggers speaking to the pandemic directly. Without ads and affiliate links. Write with some passion about the times. Don’t hide behind your sponsored posts and your affiliate links. Speak with passion!</p></li>

<li><p>You have enjoyed counting the continents and countries and discussing travel tips and itineraries. These places are made up of people though. Look at the human factor. Be bold and enterprising. Show everyone there is more to your conscience than merely counting your countries. Stand up and discuss! Write about the human factor. I have long thought that the new blogging elite are after the money pot at the end of ads and sponsored posts and affiliate links. Show me I’m wrong. Publish a thought piece on your blog on the human part of things. Surely you have seen that in your travels? Stop with the inane itineraries and plans and things to pack. Be brave and resourceful. Show that by blogging your conscience you can reach your loyal readers and give them your view on the human cost. I don’t see travel bloggers ever giving out their minds and thoughts and feelings. Now is the time to share beyond your itineraries. Write now on the people behind the itineraries.</p></li>

<li><p>Be a passionate speaker for what you do. Engage and create things of value to you but most of all use the pulpit you have to speak loudly and clearly about the world, travel and your thoughts. Show us you care more for the people in all those places.</p></li></ol>

<p>By doing this what do you lose? You lose nothing. What do you gain? You gain a voice. Become a speaker again of the human cost. Write passionately about covid-19 and how you see it’s cost.  Go back to the bloggers of yore. When you were still packing your lunch box for school. Then writers worked to create and share visions.</p>

<p>I challenge you all to do just a bit of that. Cease the endless prattle about “working with me” and tours and itineraries. Get thee back to the halcyon days of the act and art of creation. Be the voice that moves others to create.</p>

<p>Yes I would like to see bloggers create again without itineraries and plans and what to pack. Because the medium can carry the thoughts and feelings to far etched corners of this world. Be more you bloggers.  Create more and then show us your thoughts. Travel is only half if that. Consider the voyage and the people you have touched.</p>

<p>Will you do it?? Likely not. Blogging has ceased being a voice calling out and become the ATM card of the generation. It was not always like this. It’s lost the shine of its convictions. Too bad. With that loss it has truly become popularity and followers and likes and not the value of the thought.</p>
